      The internet has lost our trust. We’re frustrated with its many issues — links are broken, images don’t load, navigation is difficult, requests go slowly, pages are inaccessible — but its problems go deeper than that. Large corporations have taken control of a once open system. While they have brought efficiency, the platforms they have built are for their benefit, not ours. Online crypto-surveillance feeds petabytes of data into neural networks to serve personalized ads. These systems, dictated more by machine learning than human design, pander to and amplify our basest impulses and fears to get us to click, contributing to a polarized political climate where even basic facts cannot be agreed upon. We have quite literally created a cyborg superorganism that no one knows how to turn off.

      We need a more human internet, where its users and maintainers work together to fix its issues and rebuild trust. We are founding a More Human Internet, a nonprofit and free public platform, as an online space for this open and civil dialogue. Website maintainers will be able to triage issues reported by, solicit feedback from, announce planned improvements to, and have constructive conversations with their users. In turn, users will be able to report issues for, give feedback to, request improvements from, and have constructive conversations with maintainers of websites.

      We are assembling an inclusive team of motivated and talented volunteers to build this public platform and collaborative community. If you value teamwork and believe in this mission, we would love to work with you.
